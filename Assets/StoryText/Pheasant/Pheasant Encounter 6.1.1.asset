  storyText: "\u201COi! What do you think you\u2019re doing!\u201D one of the stagehands
    calls from above you. He\u2019s perched on a ladder, screwing in some kind of
    glass sphere to some copper piping that\u2019s suspended over the stage. He stops
    in the middle of his task and scrambles down the ladder. It wobbles, and you think
    for a moment that it may fall, but the stagehand makes it to the bottom without
    incident.\r\n\u201CWell? What\u2019re you doing up here?\u201D he demands again,
    jamming a grubby finger into your chest.\r\nYou reply:\r\n    >\u201DI was wondering
    if you would let me backstage to see Miss Beaumont. I\u2019d love to meet her!
    [To SCENEB 3.2.2]\r\n    >[Successful Charm Roll] \u201CWhy, I\u2019m quite interested
    in the field of stage and set management. I\u2019d be delighted if you could tell
    me about it.\u201D [To SCENE B3.2.4]\r\n"
