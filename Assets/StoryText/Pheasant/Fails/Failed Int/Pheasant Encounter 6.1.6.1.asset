  storyText: "\u201CI don\u2019t know, it all seems rather strange. Usually when someone
    wants to talk to me about work they send me a letter or talk to me after a show.
    You\u2019re the first to try to get into my changing room.\u201D she says, starting
    to look uncomfortable.\r\n\n\u201COh, well, I was just in a rush to talk to you
    is all. I\u2019m new to the world of the performing arts.\u201D you stammer, realizing
    that this might not have been the best way to handle the task.\r\n\n\u201CI see.
    Well, I\u2019m afraid I have a prior engagement. Thank you for your\u2026 interest.\u201D\r\n\nBeaumont
    moves quickly and closes the door completely on you before you can get even one
    more word in.\r\n\n\u201CGreat.\u201D you think, and rush out of the theater,
    not wanting to run into anyone else who would question what you\u2019re doing
    backstage.\r\n\n(Press Enter To Continue)\n"
