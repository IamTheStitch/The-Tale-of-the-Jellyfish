  storyText: "\tWith that, he goes back to setting things up and you\u2019re left
    to your own devices. You make a beeline for backstage to see if you can find Beaumont.
    Beyond the confines of the main stage room are somewhat cramped halls, lined with
    doors. On some of them are emblazoned the names of some of the regular big performers,
    given the privilege of having their own semi-permanent dressing rooms. There are
    about five of these, and the rest are unmarked. The only way you\u2019re able
    to find which one is Beaumont\u2019s is because she left her door cracked and
    you can hear her moving around inside. You knock on the door, and the sound stops.
    Moments later, the door swings the rest of the way open.\r\n\n\n(Press Enter to
