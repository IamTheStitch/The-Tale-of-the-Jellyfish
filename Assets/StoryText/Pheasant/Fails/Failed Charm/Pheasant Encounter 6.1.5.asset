  storyText: "Olivia Beaumont is glad in a flowing gold dress, her hair pinned back,
    only halfway styled for the performance. The mark of the pheasant on her face
    is barely visible beneath the heavy makeup she\u2019s wearing. She looks more
    concerned than anything at your unexpected arrival.\r\n\n\u201CYes? What is it?
    Is the show supposed to be starting? Oh, god, I lost track of time again. I\u2019m
    so sorry.\u201D she starts panicking, scrambling around the room trying to put
    herself together as fast as possible.\r\n\n\u201CNo, no. You have plenty of time,
    I\u2019m not with the theatre.\u201D you say in an attempt to calm her down. She
    slows her frantic pace a little.\r\n\n(Press Enter to Continue)\n"
