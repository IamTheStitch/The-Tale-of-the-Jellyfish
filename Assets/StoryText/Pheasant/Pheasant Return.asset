  storyText: "\tYou hasten back to the tailor shop, not wanting to call too much attention
    to Beaumont\u2019s attire. You explain that the tailor shop will serve as a meeting
    point to set up the details of the performance that she\u2019s wanted for. She
    buys it.\r\n\tOne of Hugo\u2019s thugs, light on his feet despite his large stature,
    moves silently behind the two of you and blocks the entrance as you walk in. The
    other two seize Beaumont and drag her, kicking and screaming, to the back room.\r\n"
