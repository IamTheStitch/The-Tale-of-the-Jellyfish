  storyText: "\u201C<i>This girl is going places.</i>\u201D you think. Then you remember
    why you\u2019re here.\r\n\tBeaumont\u2019s dance lasts about twenty minutes, no
    small feat for a solo performer. Everyone enjoys it, and the small crowd applauds
    enthusiastically when she finishes her dance. While the rest of the small group

    making your way down to the stage. You catch Beaumont just before she goes to
    the back.\r\n\t\u201CExcuse me! Miss Beaumont!\u201D you call, and she turns.
    Now that you\u2019re closer, you can see the edges of her mark peering out from
    beneath her heavy makeup. She\u2019s beaming, clearly happy about her good performance.\r\n\n(Press
