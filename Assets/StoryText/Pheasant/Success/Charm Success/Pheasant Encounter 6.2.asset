  storyText: "Watching the stagehands run back and forth across the stage becomes
    almost hypnotic as the minutes tick past. The theatre starts to fill up as it

    that Beaumont must be some kind of upstart. She\u2019s performing in the Beacon
    Theatre, so she must be good, but probably hasn\u2019t amassed the clout necessary
    to fill all the seats, even during the day. When the time comes around for the
    performance to start, only about three quarters of the seats are filled.\r\n\n(Press
