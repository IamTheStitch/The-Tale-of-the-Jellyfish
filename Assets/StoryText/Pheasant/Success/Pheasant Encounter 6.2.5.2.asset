  storyText: "The dance lasts only a few minutes, but it keeping up with Beaumont
    makes it feel like much longer. When she finally calls for the musicians to stop
    playing you all but collapse to the floor. Beaumont laughs, and sits down next
    to you.\r\n    \u201CYou\u2019ve surprised me,\u201D she says, \u201CI didn\u2019t
    think you had it in you. I gave my word, so I\u2019ll hear out your employer.\u201D\r\n
    \   It takes a good few minutes before you\u2019re able to stand leave the theatre.
    Beaumont doesn\u2019t even bother to change, her garish golden dress shining in
    the sunlight.\r\n\n(Press Enter to Continue)"
