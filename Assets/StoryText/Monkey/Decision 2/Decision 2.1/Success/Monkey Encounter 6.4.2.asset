    that if word got out he was hiring commoners to do palace work he\u2019d have
    an endless line of people begging for employment. So you\u2019ll need to wait
    here for a while, and then you\u2019ll be taken to the palace.\u201D you reply,
    thinking quickly on your feet. Before he has time to protest, you all but shove
    him into the shop. As it turns out, this final push isn\u2019t as heavy handed

    three thugs are upon Dubos, pinning him to the floor. They do not make any effort
    to be delicate, dragging him to the back room, presumably to chain him to the
    large stone.\r\n\u201CWorry not, even with his alchemical tricks, there\u2019s
    no way the bugger will escape us.\u201D Hugo, who is sitting back with his feet
    propped up next to a mannequin says.\r\n\n(Press Enter to Continue)"
