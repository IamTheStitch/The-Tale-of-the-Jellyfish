  storyText: "\tIgnoring the strange mist that now cloaks the floor around you, you
    move to try to grab Dubos by the wrist as he darts towards the back door. After
    taking one step, however, you lose your balance, thudding to the floor. You\u2019re
    left to watch as Dubos escapes out the back door. You roll onto your back to look
    down at your feet, and are horrified at the effects the strange golden mist had
    on them. Your feet, shoes and all, have been transformed into loaves of bread.
    You scramble away from the horrible mist before it can reach any other parts of
    your body.\r\n\tYour panic subsides after about a minute, when the effects starts
    to reverse itself, but you\u2019re unable to stand until then. Once you\u2019ve
    fully recovered, you stagger out of the shop, frustrated and still in a bit of
    shock from the spell being cast on you.\r\n\n(Press Enter to Continue)"
