  storyText: "You wrestle Dubos to the ground, using your greater strength to pin
    him. He struggles, attempting to smash the potion bottle over your head, but he
    can\u2019t quite manage it. You grab his wrist and smack his hand against the
    floor until he lets go of the bottle, and you push it as far away from the struggle
    as you can. Dubos starts to scream, and in a desperate move you jump off of him
    and grab a very large book from the table in the center of the room. You swing
    the book in a wide arc, hitting Dubos in the head as he tries to get up from the
    floor. He falls back down, unconscious.\r\n\n(Press Enter to Continue)"
