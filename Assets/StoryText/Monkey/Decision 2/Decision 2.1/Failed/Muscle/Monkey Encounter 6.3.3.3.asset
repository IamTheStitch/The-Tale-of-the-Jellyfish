  storyText: "You throw caution to the wind and lunge at Dubos, trying to get to him
    before he can throw the strange potion at you. He sidesteps, and you very nearly
    lose your footing, but manage to recover. You whirl around to face the alchemist
    again, and make another drastic leap in an attempt to bring him down.\r\n> [Failed
    Muscle Roll] Dubos is faster than you, and throws the vial at your feet. It explodes
    into a golden fog that billows out to cover much of the floor around you. [To
    SCENE B1.4.4]\r\n>[Successful Muscle Roll] You\u2019re light on your feet and
    get to Dubos before he can so much as let go of the vial. [To SCENE B1.4.5]\r\n"
