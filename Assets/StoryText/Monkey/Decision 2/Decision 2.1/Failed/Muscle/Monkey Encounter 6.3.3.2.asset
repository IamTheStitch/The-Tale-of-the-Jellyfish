  storyText: "You throw caution to the wind and lunge at Dubos, trying to get to him
    before he can throw the strange potion at you. He sidesteps, and you very nearly
    lose your footing, but manage to recover. You whirl around to face the alchemist
    again, and make another drastic leap in an attempt to bring him down.\r\n\n(Roll
    Dice to show a possible Outcome(s), this will use Muscle)\n"
