    should really reconsider. You won\u2019t regret it.\u201D you blurt out, trying
    desperately to convince the alchemist. You take a few tentative steps towards
    him. He doesn\u2019t look up at you, instead leaning down to pull something from
    beneath the table he\u2019s working at. When he stands up, he has a glass vial
    filled with a swirling golden substance clutched in his hand.\r\n\u201CI won\u2019t
    ask again,\u201D he says, cautiously stepping out from behind the table and towards
    a backdoor, tucked between two shelves along the back wall where you couldn\u2019t
    see it at first.\r\n\n>Back up to the front door and get out of there before you
    find out the hard way what he has in that bottle.\n>Try to take him down! \r"
