  storyText: "The two of you travel all the way back to Dubos\u2019s shop, the situation
    beginning to grow irritating. You squeeze through the swarm of people in the market
    square and once again are cloaked in the tranquility of the quiet shop. You lean
    against the wall and tap your foot while Dubos rifles around one of the shelves.\r\nDubos
    pulls a glass bottle with a spherical body from the back of the shelf. It\u2019s
    filled with a swirling golden substance. Dubos turns to you, and raises the bottle
    above his head, ready to throw it in your direction.\r\n\u201CI, unfortunately,
    will be unable to join you for the return trip to the palace. I don\u2019t know
    what exactly you want with me, but I can tell it\u2019s nothing good. So why don\u2019t
    you leave here and we can forget this whole thing.\u201D\r\n\n(Press Enter to
