  storyText: "As he speaks, Dubos is taking slow, careful steps towards the center
    of the room. Over his shoulder, you spy a back door tucked discreetly between
    two shelves. You\u2019re tensed, afraid of what the bottle clutched in the alchemist\u2019s
    hand might be capable of.\r\n\r\n>You back away, opening the door to leave without
    ever taking your eyes off the swirling golden potion. \n>You throw caution to
    the wind, and try to take Dubos by force!"
