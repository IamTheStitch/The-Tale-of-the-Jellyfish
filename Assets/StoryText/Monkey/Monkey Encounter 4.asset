  storyText: "\u201CGood day to you, sir.\u201D says the man called Hector Dubos,
    if the information given to you by Hugo is to be believed. He\u2019s short, and
    has a tangled rats\u2019 nest of chestnut hair atop his head. His clothes are
    plain, and he wears a pair of thick spectacles. His face is framed by thick sideburns,
    slightly darker in color than his hair.\r\n\u201CIn what way may I assist you?\u201D
    he finishes the customary shopkeeper greeting.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m interested in
    making use of your, ah, services.\u201D you reply.\r\n\u201CSomething important?\u201D
    Dubos asks. Your heartbeat quickens as you think he may already be onto you. He
    seems to see the look of concern on your face, and adds:\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re
    awfully clean compared to my usual clientele. Those clothes look brand new. Don\u2019t
    see that much these days, at least not in this part of the city.\u201D\r\n\n(Press
