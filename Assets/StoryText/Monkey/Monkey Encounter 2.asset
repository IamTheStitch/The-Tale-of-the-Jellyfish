  storyText: "The market consists of both storefronts and street vendors. The latter
    make up the majority, with temporary tents and stands set up all over the area.
    Merchants do as much as possible to call attention to themselves, most decorate
    their tents with brightly colored banners and shout as loud as possible to turn
    heads. Between them and the crowd of customers and passers-through, you can barely
    hear yourself think, and you\u2019re accustomed to this kind of chaos. <i>No way
    anyone who grew up in the palace or some manor could navigate this place,</i>
    you think. It takes you a while, but you eventually catch sight of the store front
    with <i>Magie du Singe</i> painted above the door. You push your way through the
    crowd and duck inside.\r\n\n(Press Enter to Continue)"
