  storyText: "\x1C\"Oh. Yes. Well, to tell the truth, I did come here on business
    from the palace. You see, it\x19s a royal matter that I was sent here to inquire
    about.\"\x1D you say, trying to play off your nervousness about being discovered.\r\n\u201CYou
    don\u2019t say? What exactly could the royal family want with me, a humble servant
    of the people?\u201D Dubos responds, narrowing his eyes.\r\n<b>You reply:\r</b>\n>
    \x1CWhy, your talents are known throughout the city! Truly, you\x19re a master
    of your craft. The King himself has taken notice of you, and wants to employ you
    as his personal court alchemist!\x1D \n > <i>[Successful Charm Roll]</i> \x1CNothing
    terribly urgent, at least not for the royal family. In truth, it\x19s a simple
    matter of performing some kind of ritual to rid the palace of a rodent infestation.
    The court alchemist couldn\x19t be bothered to tend to it.\x1D "
