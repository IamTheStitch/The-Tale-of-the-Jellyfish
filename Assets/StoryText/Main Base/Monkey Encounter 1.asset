  storyText: "You make your way on foot to the city\u2019s central market district.
    Though it\u2019s been some time since you walked the streets, you have no trouble

    walks around long enough they\u2019re bound to end up there. Most everywhere in
    the city is busy these days, but the market is something else entirely. As you
    close in on it, the crowd grows more and more dense. By the time you\u2019re inside
    the market square, you can barely squeeze through the immense crowd gathered there.\r\n\n(Press
