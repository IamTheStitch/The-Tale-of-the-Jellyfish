  storyText: "\tHugo hands you a slip of paper with three names and locations on it.
    You read it carefully, letting out a sigh when you get to the last name on the
    list. Serge Leroux. You know Serge Leroux, the two of you grew up in the same
    neighborhood. You stuff the paper in your pocket and walk out the front door,
    determined to get the task done.\r\n\r\nYou head:\r\n\n>To the market district,
    to find the shopkeeper called Hector Dubos [To SCENE B1.1]\r\n>Downtown via steam-trolley,
    to the home of Serge Leroux: your old friend. [To SCENE B2.1]\r\n>A few blocks
    over to the Millenium Theatre, to find the dancer called Olivia Beaumont [To SCENE
    B3.1]\r\n"
