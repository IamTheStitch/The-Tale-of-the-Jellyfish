  storyText: "The room you are deposited in is plain, very much unlike the rest of
    the palace. A few candles dimly illuminate the dark wood walls and simple furniture.
    There are no windows. A small round table and two wood chairs have been placed
    haphazardly in the room. You are left alone to wait for some time. As you watch
    the candles melt away, you wonder what exactly the King has in store for you.\r\n\nYou\u2019re
    beginning to nod off when the door to the room opens and you are joined by a woman
    that you recognize as the head of the King\u2019s spy network. After closing the
    door behind her, she sits down across the table from you, locking eyes with you
    and saying nothing. The candlelight casts eerie shadows on her face, and her dark
    clothing makes her seem almost incorporeal in the low light.\r\n\n\u201CRight
    then,\u201D she says, \u201CYou\u2019ve landed yourself in quite the rut.\u201D\r\nYou
    nod in agreement.\r\n\n\u201CI\u2019ve pulled everything together to make this
    as easy as possible for you. King was wise to pick you for the job, everyone in
    my employ are cutthroats and thugs, and they\u2019re watched constantly. I spend
    half my time trying to keep snoops from the other kingdoms off my arse.\u201D
    she grins wryly at this. You don\u2019t find it as amusing.\r\n\n(Press Enter
