  storyText: "\u201CName\u2019s Hugo.\u201D the old man says. His voice sounds just
    as slimy as he looks. He leads you inside the tailor shop, hobbling at a snail\u2019s
    pace. Inside, you find a completely ordinary shop. Mannequins with different outfits
    are standing posed all about the front room. The walls are covered with velvet
    wallpaper of a deep crimson color. The wood floor is polished to the point that
    when you look down, you can see your face in it.\r\n\nHugo, though slow, has crossed
    the room as you gawk at everything.\r\n\n(Press Enter to Continue)"
