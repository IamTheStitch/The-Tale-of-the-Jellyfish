  storyText: "\u201CBut you, you\u2019re an unknown. Nobody\u2019ll recognize you.
    So, then, the setup is this: I\u2019ve arranged to use a small tailor shop not
    far from the palace. My boys are gonna make some, ah, adjustments to the space
    to better suit our needs. Do whatever you have to to these saps to get them to
    return with you to that shop, and we\u2019ll take care of the rest. When the King
    says he wants them to come willingly, note that he doesn\u2019t necessarily mean
    that they\u2019ll know why they\u2019re coming willingly. Simple enough for you?\u201D\r\n\nYou
    nod again, and she cracks another smile. Once again you don\u2019t know what\u2019s
    so funny, but she doesn\u2019t bother explaining anything else to you.\r\n\nAs
    quickly as you arrived, you are again pulled from the little wooden side room.
    You\u2019re taken to the stables and put hurriedly in a carriage that looks an
    awful lot like it belongs to some kind of merchant. You find inside a change of
    clothes, those of a commoner. The carriage pulls out from the palace, and you
    change into your new garments during the ride. When at last you are deposited
    at the tailor shop, an old man with pale and pockmarked skin greets you.\r\n\n(Press
