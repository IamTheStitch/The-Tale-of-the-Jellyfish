    \   No one seems to hear her but you. If they do they don\u2019t say anything
    in response. The King leans to one of the advisors close to him and motions in
    your direction. You can\u2019t tell if his motion is at you or someone near you.
    The man he\u2019s questioning nods, and whispers something back. \n\tThe King
    rubs his right temple. Another minute passes, your nervousness begins to worsen
    as you notice the King glancing at you repeatedly while deep in thought. He stands,
    and walks towards your part of the table.\r\n\n    \u201CWould you join me for
    a moment?\u201D he says, peering down at you. You blink, your nerves getting the
    best of you for a moment. The King raises one eyebrow, not breaking eye contact.
    The advisor seating to your left nudges you and you hurriedly stand.\r\n\n    \u201CY-yes.
    Of course.\u201D you stutter, and the King leads you away from the central table.
    \r\n    \u201CAm I to understand that you were not born of noble blood?\u201D
    he asks bluntly, once you\u2019re more or less out of earshot from the rest of
    the assembly. You feel your cheeks flush.\r\n\r\n(Press Enter to Continue)"
