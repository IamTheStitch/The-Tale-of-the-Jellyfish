    you admit. The circumstances of your low birth are not usually something you like
    to discuss, particularly not with the Dragon King. He looks you up and down before
    continuing.\r\n\n    \u201CNo one- and I do mean no one- has ever done what you
    have done. Not in my kingdom and not in any of the other Great Kingdoms, to the
    extent of my knowledge. You transcended the caste system that is the basis for
    our society. I should congratulate you on your extraordinary achievement.\u201D\r\n\n
    \   You manage to stammer out your thanks, though you\u2019re not sure if that\u2019s
    what the King wants. He continues:\r\n\n    \u201CThat is why I consider it very
    lucky that you are present here. For you see, you are very uniquely positioned
    to save the Queen\u2019s life.\u201D\r\n\n    The King looks at you solemnly,
    seemingly waiting for a response. Your silence speaks for you.\r\n\r\n(Press Enter
