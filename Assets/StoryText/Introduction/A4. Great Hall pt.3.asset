  storyText: "\t\u201CHo there, Jellyfish!\u201D You turn to see who is addressing
    you. It\u2019s Tatiana Messier, better known as the Boar. Unlike you, she chose
    to name herself after her mark. It certainly suits her though. She\u2019s bigger
    and stronger than most of the men at court, and twice as aggressive as most of
    them as well.\r\n\n\u201CWhat d\u2019you think this meeting is all about then?\u201D
    Tatiana the Boar asks, jogging up alongside you.\r She walks briskly, aided by

    dresses customary for ladies of the aristocracy.\n\n(Press Enter to Continue)"
