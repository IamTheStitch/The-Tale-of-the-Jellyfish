  storyText: "\u201CWhat was said a few moments ago about the people needed coming
    to the palace willingly gave me cause to consider your peculiar circumstances.
    I am well aware of the divide that exists between the nobility and the common
    folk in my kingdom. The contempt that much of the lower class holds for the upper
    is no secret to me. Thus, there are very few who I could send on this errand to
    bring those ever so critical individuals back here for me. Anyone in my service
    would be sniffed out immediately, become suspicious. Anyone, save for you.\u201D\r\n
    \   You can hardly believe what you\u2019re hearing. A task given to you, given
    personally no less, by the King himself. You think back to the endless days and
    nights you spent in pursuit of a chance, just a chance at escaping the grit and
    hardship that comes with being born amongst lowlives. And now you have the opportunity
    to do something that will cement your place as invaluable on the King\u2019s court.
    But what of the task? You rub the mark on the side of your face as you consider
    the magnitude of the crime you are being asked to commit.\r\n\n(Press Enter to
    Continue)"
