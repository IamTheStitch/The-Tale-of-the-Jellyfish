    for what feels like a long time. Shouts bounce around the room, directed nowhere
    in particular.\r\n\n    \u201CPreposterous!\u201D\r\n\n    \u201CBut it\u2019s
    for the Queen!\u201D\r\n\n    \u201CIt\u2019s against the law!\u201D\r\n\n    \u201CShe

    matter?\u201D\r\n\n    The King rises and slams his massive fist down on the table,\r\n
    \   \u201CENOUGH!\u201D\r\n\n    His shout rings through the grand hall, and you
    think it was probably heard throughout the palace.\r\n\r\n(Press Enter to Continue)"
