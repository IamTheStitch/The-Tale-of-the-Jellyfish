  storyText: "You share a chuckle with Tatiana over the memory and walk the rest of
    the way to the grand hall in silence. Despite your joking, you both know that
    a meeting called this urgently could only mean trouble.\n \nAlong the edge of
    the courtyard, workers are slaving away putting in metal piping that will eventually
    run all around the interior and exterior of the castle. Steam power is not that
    new of an invention, but the Dragon king is late to adopt its uses on the palace
    grounds. Other advisors are heading in the same direction as you are, coming from
    all corners of the palace. When you approach the large doors to the grand hall,
    you find that they\u2019re already open. You follow close behind Tatiana as she
    sidles through to the grand hall.\n\n(Press Enter to Continue)"
