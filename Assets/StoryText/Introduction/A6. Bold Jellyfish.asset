    worked very hard to get where you are. It would be a terrible shame for all that
    effort to amount to nothing. For you to rot in a pauper\u2019s grave, having done
    nothing with a miserable excuse for a life.\u201D\r\nHis voice has risen now,
    and you feel as though you are shrinking at his feet.\r\n\n(Press Enter to Continue)"
