  storyText: "You glance across the room, and see that all eyes at the table are fixed
    on you and the King. You\u2019re sure they can\u2019t hear what was said, but
    they don\u2019t need to. You lock eyes with Tatiana, and it\u2019s as if she knows
    exactly what you\u2019ve been asked to do. Thoughts whirl in your head, visions
    of grandeur as the King\u2019s right hand, and of the look on Tatiana\u2019s face
    when she finds out what you\u2019ve done.\r\n\n<b>You turn back to the King, and
    reply:\r</b>\n    >\u201CYour majesty, it would be an honor and privilege to serve
    you so.\u201D\n    >\u201CI\u2019m sorry your majesty, but I cannot do what you
    ask. It just isn\u2019t right.\u201D\n"
