  storyText: "As much as your don\u2019t want to, you\u2019re forced to split up with
    Tatiana once inside. Your seat at the long table in the middle of the hall is
    on the opposite side from hers. It makes sense, as you\u2019re an advisor on city
    planning while she\u2019s an expert on military matters. \n\nThere\u2019s a low
    murmuring throughout the room, everyone speculating about what the cause of the
    sudden gathering might be. The grand hall is not so grand today, as there are
    no banquets on the horizon. The gaudy decor that usually covers every surface
    of the massive room is nowhere to be seen, put away until the time for festivities
    comes again. \n\nThe room feels empty, despite the number of people gathered around
    the table. You awkwardly take your seat, acutely aware that you are one of the
    youngest people in the room, and wait for another few minutes for the rest of
    the advisors to trickle in.\r\n\n(Press Enter to Continue)"
