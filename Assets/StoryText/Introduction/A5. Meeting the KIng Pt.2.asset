  storyText: "The King\u2019s arrival is preceded by the sound of his lumbering footsteps.
    The door at the rear of the grand hall, specially made to accommodate his great
    height, swings open. Despite the extra space, the King\u2019s frame still took
    up the entire frame. He steps through, slowly. He\u2019s clad in his usual opulent
    attire, but he does not carry his usual air of regality. His eyes are sunken,
    his shoulder-length hair is unkempt. He does not, by any account, look well.\r\n
    \   As soon as the King enters the room, everyone rises from the table. The silence
    hanging in the air is broken by the screeching of the King\u2019s vast metal chair
    as it scrapes against the marble floor. He doesn\u2019t even need to strain to
    pull it aside. The King slumps into the throne, and stares at nothing for a few
    moments before motioning for the advisors to sit. There are a few moments of shuffling
    before silence once again overtakes the room.\r\n\n(Press Enter to Continue)"
