    exactly the reason I have assembled you here. My trusted advisors. I considered
    keeping this between myself and only a select few people, but in the end I decided
    that complete transparency would be the best course of action to take.\u201D he
    glares sternly around the room. The first person who dares to speak is a foreign
    affairs advisor. You don\u2019t remember their name.\r\n\n    \u201CYour Majesty,
    surely you can\u2019t believe that would work? Where do you think you\u2019ll

    to willingly give their lives for this endeavor.\u201D\r\n\n    Someone else pipes

    Trozzo, \u201Care the liver of one who bears the mark of the monkey, the blood
    of one who bears the mark of a pheasant, and the heart of one with the mark of
    the dog. If the old texts are to be believed, that is.\u201D\r\n\n(Press Enter
